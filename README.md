# Beast.js

An ultra-simple clone of the 1984 [Beast](http://theodor.lauppert.ws/games/beast.htm) DOS game that I had fond memories of playing as kid. I made it after working through the first part of Mozilla's [canvas tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) with my 9-year-old son. Credit for all the gameplay ideas goes to the original authors: Dan Baker, Alan Brown, Mark Hamilton and Derrick Shadel.

## Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move. You are the blue square, if the black "beasts" touch you, you die (you can tell because the game stops moving). Refresh the browser to start again. You can squish the Beasts between two bricks -- squish all the beasts and you win.
